First, it will require a search functionality for users to query and retrieve company objects. The company objects should store comprehensive details about the companies, including their associated legal documents. These documents might be in various formats such as PDF, Word, etc., so the backend should be able to handle a variety of document types.\n\nSecond, a parsing feature will need to be implemented that enables ChatGPT, or a similar AI model, to parse the legal document's text to generate a 10-question multiple-choice quiz. This process will require a sophisticated algorithm to create meaningful and relevant questions based on the document's content, ensuring a valuable learning experience for the user.\n\nThird, the backend needs to have an evaluation system that can score the quizzes taken by users. It should be capable of handling answers submitted by the user, calculating the score, and comparing it against the pass mark of 80%. If the user achieves the pass mark or higher, this should trigger an event that updates the user's profile with an achievement.\n\nThe user profile management system is another crucial part. It should be able to track and manage user achievements, which includes the addition of new achievements when a user passes a quiz. It should also provide an interface for users to view their achievement history.\n\nFurthermore, the system should have a robust user authentication system to ensure data privacy and security. This includes secure user registration, login, and password management functionalities. The system should also be able to handle potential high load and scale based on the number of users and the data volume to maintain performance and response times.\n\nFinally, the backend should be developed with maintainability in mind. It should follow best practices in code structure and organization, incorporate thorough testing methodologies, and allow for easy updates and modifications in the future as user requirements or technologies evolve."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Clarification needed:\n- What specific legal documents will be parsed by ChatGPT to generate quizzes?\n- What kind of achievements will be added to a user's profile when they pass a quiz?\n- What is the expected number of users and data volume that the system should be able to handle?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Update the prompt to include these details: types of legal documents a company could have a one to many relationship with.
