We are building an application that allows users to browse companies, read a company's terms of service, and take a quiz to verify they understand the terms of service. MVC components split in separate files. Use python and flask for a rest api, simulate a database with sqlite, angular for the frontend. The app should use chat gpt to parse the terms of service and generate 10 multiple choice questions that when answered correct show trust that the user understands the material. The user should get at least 80% correct to be considered passing. Use Auth0 for authentication and authorization, there is an account creation but no fee. If the user fails they do not get a badge. If the user passes add the company to their profile as a company they are subject matter experts of. The terms of service for a company should be viewable at all times, but a user can only take the quiz for that company once every 14 days. There should be a company search page the user can visit with filters and a search bar.
